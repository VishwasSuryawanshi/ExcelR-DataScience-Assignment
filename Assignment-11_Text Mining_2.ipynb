       " \"Perfect budget phone. Do not expect flagship features. I use iPhone 12 Pro Max and got this to have a second device as I need Android for work.Unlocking the screen is not the fastest. Face recognition doesn't work with glasses on, fingerprint is located on the side button(power button) I found it tricky cause i wake up the screen with double tap. Fingerprint reader works however not the best. Camera also is not satisfying, especially at night. But remember this is budget phone, and for this price i think it is pretty good deal. I will keep it.\",\n",

       " \"Seems great so far. New 5G tower about 100 feet from the house so it always getting 5 bars now. It's heavy but the price for a mega sized battery. Seems snappy and responds well. I am not a power user of smart phones but of computers so if i can run a few apps that are not games and it does it well, I am happy. I am happy. The display is gorgeous and the camera is good but not if you think you are some auteur. I am using it with Mint mobile and the two have a very low cost of ownership.\",\n",
       " \"This phone is pretty much a disappointment. I've owned a number of iPhones and Android devices in the past, from $800+ devices down to $200 phones like this one. I cannot recall when was the last time I had such a terrible phone. After a month of use, I'm throwing it in the trash to buy another. Money wasted.To summarize its specs and how they actually are:- The screen is advertised as a big thing, but forget about it! You're never gonna get 90 Hz because the processor cannot keep up. Scrolling through messages or Instagram feed you see lag, so what's the point of a 90Hz capable screen if it lags and you see it at 30 Hz? Color accuracy is good though- The phone's performance is the worst I've seen in the past decade! Forget about multitasking, with no open background apps, when I go to the supermarket I cannot switch between the shopping list app and the coupons app, because every time I switch the apps reload from the beginning. Screen lags, apps take forever to open, and I'm not even talking about games. Never had such a slow and frustrating experience texting, as the phone can't keep up with my typing on the keyboard nor scrolling through threads.- The camera is absolute potato. Remember to grab another camera with you because this is the absolute worst. For fun I compared the camera with that of my previous phones, and found it to be mostly similar in various lightning conditions to that of my Sony Ericsson C901, released in 2009!!!- The battery is huge and great, I can get a full day of power out of the phone with no issue. If the phone wasn't so slow and I did not have to wait for a minute for snapchat to open or type messages over and over again until the keyboard keeps up, my screen time would be inferior and I bet the battery would last even longer.- The fingerprint reader is slow and makes mistakes more times that it unlocks the phone. Face scan is also pretty much useless, as it depends on the camera which is potato. The last time I had a phone without a biometric unlock was 2014. Today, I am dragged 7 years back in time to once again use passwords to unlock my phone. It's extremely frustratingSTAY AWAY! Buy Xiaomi\",\n",
